\chapter{Concluding remarks}
\label{sec:Remarks}
We have learned how to implement and test an algorithm. From these test we have enhanced our original algorithm. We have also learned that the solution to any problem is in essence a ``hit or miss''. An engineer must have the right idea at the right time with the right skills to solve a problem. Our first approaches, using a $k$D-tree and making a backtracking algorithm were the wrong ideas. The first because it was too complex to implement, the second because the practical running time was worthless (caused by both the large stack problems of FreePascal and the properties of any backtracking algorithm ).
