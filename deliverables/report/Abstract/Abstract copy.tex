This report is about reconstructing a curve from of a set of given points. The goal of this 2d-reconstruction problem is to implement four algorithms each for a different type of curve: closed, open, self-intersecting and up-to-5. Where up-to-5 means that the given set of points has two curves, possibly more, but no more than five. This means that the algorithm should be able distinct the different curves so it draws them correctly.\\
The results of our algorithms were the algorithms NearestNeighbor and the corrected version DirectedNearestNeigbor. We have designed, implemented and tested an algorithm to solve the different curves. We have repeated this process after each batch of experiments, using the results of those experiments to improve our algorithm. \\
