    \begin{abstract}
      This report is about reconstructing a curve from of a set of given points. We have created three different algorithms to solve the four given problems. \emph{ImprovedNearestNeigbor} is used to solve open and closed curves, \emph{DirectedNearestNeighbor} is used to solve all intersecting curves and \emph{UpToFiveSort} solves curves that consists of two to five, non-intersecting, curves. These algorithms run, respectively, in $O(n^{2}), O(n^{2})$ time, both theoretically and in practice. \emph{UpToFiveSort} theoretically runs in $O(n^{3})$, but in practice in $O(n)$. We have also tested and evaluated each of our algorithms, in which we concluded that we can solve most, but not all, test cases within the given time of 5 minutes.
