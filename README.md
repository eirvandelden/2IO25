# 2IO25

These are the documents and application we made for the course 2IO25 at the TU/e in 2009/2010.

In the folder `Code/`, you can find the app we made for solving a "connect the dots" problem, using several different algorithms.

We have example import files in the `TC/` folder

The report in `deliverables/report` contains some example images of how the algorithms worked.
